**Sweep that !**

1. **Project Overview**

    Sweep That! is an immersive memory-matching game that blends traditional Thai poetry with engaging gameplay. Players test their memory by matching beautifully designed cards featuring excerpts from classic Thai literary works such as นิราศภูเขาทอง (Nirat Phukhao Thong), ลิลิตตะเลงพ่าย (Lilit Taleng Phai), พระอภัยมณี (Phra Aphai Mani), and นิราศเมืองแกลง (Nirat Mueang Klaeng). The game features a streamlined 36-card layout for faster-paced matches, where players compete against the computer to collect all 18 cards assigned to their side.<br>

    This project’s game will contain 36 cards in total, 18 for each side of players. After the game ends it will show the stats of the player in this round along with the stats of the player all the round before and analyze it at which point you need to develop, such as you need to sweep the card more quickly! Or maybe you need to memorize the card and their position more correctly.<br>

2. **Project Review**

    Card matching game : card matching game has a not so similar but useful system to Karuta game, so I can use this game’s project as a reference and develop it into thai Karuta card game ‘Sweep that!’.<br>

3. **Game Concept**

    Sweep That! reinvents the traditional Japanese Karuta card game with a uniquely Thai twist, blending fast-paced memory gameplay with the beauty of classic Thai poetry. Players engage in an exciting battle of wits, matching cards featuring iconic Thai literary works like นิราศภูเขาทong (Nirat Phukhao Thong), ลิลิตตะเลงพ่าย (Lilit Taleng Phai), พระอภัยมณี (Phra Aphai Mani), and นิราศเมืองแกลง (Nirat Mueang Klaeng).<br>

    Core Gameplay:<br>
    *36-Poem Card Deck:* A carefully curated selection of Thai poems replaces the original 50-card setup, optimized for balanced and strategic play.<br>
    *Head-to-Head Memory Duel:* Players compete against the computer to be the first to "sweep" all 18 of their assigned cards from the board.<br>
    *Audio-Visual Matching:* Listen to narrated poem excerpts and race to identify and select the corresponding card before your opponent.<br>
    *Two Distinct Modes:*<br>
    *Normal Mode:* Pure memory challenge, match poems against the clock.<br>
    *Hard Mode:* Features Rahu (ราหู), a mythical serpent that devours random position of the board, forcing players to rely on their memory as some part of the board is invisible.<br>

    The selling point of this game is the adaptation of Karuta to thai styles card game. This game is a great way to learn about Thai poetry while having fun and improving your reaction time.
